# FUTURE_DS_03
🎓 Student Feedback Analysis
📌 Project Overview

College events like tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities often collect student feedback — but are we really using it effectively?

This project focuses on analyzing text and rating-based feedback submitted by students after attending campus events. Using Python & NLP techniques, the goal is to understand satisfaction levels, identify improvement areas, and provide actionable insights for event organizers.

🎯 Objectives

✅ Clean and prepare feedback data (from Google Forms CSV export)

✅ Analyze ratings (1–5 scale) to find satisfaction patterns

✅ Perform sentiment analysis on comments (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

✅ Visualize results using charts, pie graphs, and word clouds

✅ Suggest recommendations for better future events

🧠 Skills Learned

Data cleaning & preprocessing with pandas

Sentiment Analysis using VADER (NLP)

Data visualization with matplotlib & seaborn

Word cloud generation for textual feedback

Building a mini dashboard inside Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dashboard Highlights

Bar Chart – Average rating per question

Pie Chart – Sentiment distribution (Positive / Negative / Neutral)

Word Cloud – Most common words in student feedback

Mini Report – Key recommendations for event organizers


🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-feedback-analysis.git
cd student-feedback-analysis


Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook Student_Feedback_Analysis.ipynb


Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn vaderSentiment wordcloud


Run all cells to see analysis, visualizations, and recommendations.

📌 Sample Insights

Most students rated the workshops highly (4★ & 5★)

A few negative comments highlighted time management issues

Word cloud shows frequent mentions of “interactive”, “useful”, “fun”

Recommendation: More Q&A sessions and better scheduling
